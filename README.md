---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.9 or newer** ([Check version](https://www.python.org/downloads/): `python3 --version`)
- **pip** (usually comes with Python)
- **Anthropic API key** ([Get one here](https://console.anthropic.com/) - paid service)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd quotes-manager
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install the package (includes all dependencies)
pip install .
```

**What this does:** Installs Quotes Manager and all required packages (typer, rich, anthropic, etc.)

### Step 3: Set Up PATH

Add Python's bin directory to your PATH so `quotes` works from anywhere:

```bash
# For macOS - add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:
# Replace X.X with your Python version (check with: python3 --version)
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/X.X/bin:$PATH"

# Example for Python 3.11:
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.11/bin:$PATH"

# For Linux - add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Then reload:
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

**Tip:** Find your Python version with `python3 --version`

**Verify it works:**
```bash
quotes --version
# Should show: Quotes Manager v1.5.0
```

### Step 4: Configure API Key

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your Anthropic API key:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Get an API key from [Anthropic's Console](https://console.anthropic.com/).

### Step 5: Run Quotes Manager

```bash
# Launch interactive menu
quotes

# Or if you used requirements.txt only:
python3 main.py
```

**Expected result:** You should see a colorful interactive menu.

### Troubleshooting Installation

**"quotes: command not found"?**
- Check PATH is set correctly (Step 3)
- Or just run: `python3 main.py` from the quotes-manager directory

**Python version too old?**
- Install Python 3.9+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Check version: `python3 --version`

**"No module named 'typer'" or similar?**
- Install dependencies: `pip install .`
- Make sure you're in the quotes-manager directory

**API key not working?**
- Check `.env` file has correct format: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`
- No quotes around the key
- No spaces around the `=`

## How to Use

### Interactive Menu (Recommended)

```bash

## Common Tasks

### Adding Your First Quote

```bash
quotes add
```

**Default: Terminal with full arrow key support**
- By default, you get a rich multiline editor right in your terminal
- Use arrow keys (↑↓←→) to navigate anywhere in your text
- Ctrl+D or Esc+Enter to finish
- Auto-cleans pasted content (removes borders, ANSI codes, etc.)
- Requires `prompt_toolkit` (included in requirements.txt)

**Alternative: Use your external editor**
- For longer quotes, use your preferred editor
- Run with the flag:
  ```bash path=null start=null
  quotes add --editor
  ```
- Set your editor:
  ```bash path=null start=null
  export EDITOR="code -w"   # VS Code
  export EDITOR="nano"       # Nano (default)
  export EDITOR="vim"        # Vim
  ```
- Make it default:
  ```bash path=null start=null
  export QUOTES_USE_EDITOR=1
  ```

**Fallback: Simple mode**
- If prompt_toolkit isn't available, falls back to sentinel mode
- Type your text, then type END on its own line to finish

Example:
```text path=null start=null
Quote text (multi-line supported)
Paste or type your text. When finished, type END on its own line and press Enter.

│  Your pasted quote line 1
│  Your pasted quote line 2
END
```
Saved text becomes:
```text path=null start=null
Your pasted quote line 1
Your pasted quote line 2
```

The tool will guide you through:
1. Enter the quote text (multi-line; finish with END)
2. Enter the author (or let AI identify them)
3. Add source, personal notes (optional)
4. AI suggests categories - select which ones fit
5. AI checks for duplicates

### Viewing Today's Quote

```bash
quotes daily
```

Shows a different quote each day. No repeats for 21 days!

### Searching Your Quotes

```bash
# Search by keyword
quotes search "motivation"

# Filter by category
quotes list --category inspiration

# Filter by author
quotes list --author "Maya Angelou"
```

### Getting Daily Quotes Automatically

```bash
quotes setup
```

This adds a quote to your terminal startup (optional).

### Changing Colors

```bash
quotes theme
```

Choose from 5 themes: auto, dark, light, high-contrast, or none.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Anthropic API key (paid service for AI features)

---

## Data Storage & Privacy

- 🏠 **Your quotes stay local** in `local_data/personal_data/quotes.json`
- 🔒 **API keys** stored in `.env` file (never committed to git)
- ☁️ **AI analysis** sent to Claude API only when you add/explain quotes
- 🚫 **No tracking** or telemetry
- ✅ **Open source** - review all code yourself

**Your private files:**
- `local_data/` - Your quotes and data
- `.env` - Your API key
- Both are automatically excluded from git
