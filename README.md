## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd quotes-manager

# Install in development mode (creates 'quotes' command)
pip install -e .

# Set up your API key
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your Anthropic API key:
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Set up shell integration (optional but recommended)
quotes setup
```

After installation, you can use the `quotes` command directly from anywhere in your terminal!

**Note:** If the `quotes` command is not found, you may need to add Python's user bin directory to your PATH:

```bash
# For macOS/Linux, add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc:
export PATH="$HOME/Library/Python/3.9/bin:$PATH"  # macOS
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"              # Linux

# Then reload your shell:
source ~/.zshrc  # or source ~/.bashrc
```

## Quick Start

### Add your first quote

```bash
quotes add
```

Follow the interactive prompts to add a quote with context. The AI will:
- Identify the author if you don't know it
- Check for duplicates in your collection
- Suggest relevant categories

### See your daily quote

```bash
quotes daily
```

Or set up shell integration so it appears automatically when you open your terminal!

### Search your collection

```bash
# Search by keyword
quotes search "passion work"

# List all quotes
quotes list

# Filter by category
quotes list --category inspiration

# Filter by author
quotes list --author "Steve Jobs"
```

```bash
quotes view <quote-id>
```

Press `E` to get an AI explanation of the quote!
