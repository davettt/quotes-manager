- No functionality changes, documentation clarity only

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- **Development tooling infrastructure**:
  - `pyproject.toml`: Centralized configuration for Black, Ruff, Bandit
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: Automatic git hooks for code quality
  - `bandit` security scanner for vulnerability detection
  - `DEVELOPMENT.md`: Complete development setup and workflow guide
- **Pre-commit hooks** run automatically before commits:
  - Code formatting (Black)
  - Linting (Ruff with auto-fix)
  - Security scanning (Bandit)
  - File validation (whitespace, YAML, JSON, TOML)
  - Private key detection
  - Python AST validation

### Changed

- Updated `.claude/workflow/code_standards.md` with pre-commit workflow
- Updated `.claude/README.md` with new tooling references
- Updated `requirements.txt` with bandit and pre-commit

### Developer Notes
- **Setup:** Run `pre-commit install` to enable automatic checks
- **Manual run:** Use `pre-commit run --all-files`
- **Documentation:** See `DEVELOPMENT.md` for complete guide
- **Standards:** See `.claude/workflow/code_standards.md` for workflow

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-11

- Added explicit `theme=None` to all command calls in menu to prevent Typer object corruption
- **Dynamic theme switching**: `get_color()` now imports module and accesses attribute to get current THEME value
- Fixed Python import caching issue by using `import utils.display` then `utils.display.THEME` instead of `from utils.display import THEME`
